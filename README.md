### MP-1 : IMU step counter
- From smartphone accelerometer data with 3 different human modes, peak-detection based on adaptive thresholding is performed to count the foot steps. 
### MP-2 : 3D Orientation tracking from IMU data
- From phone data, initial orientation is calculated.
- Based on initial orientation, gyro integration is performed to estimate real-time 3D orientation tracking.

### Project title: Indoor Localization using Weighted Least Squares for Multiple Voice Assistants with Multiple MIC arrays
- In this work, indoor localization technique using multiple voice assistant devices containing multiple MIC (microphone) arrays is introduced. AoA (Angle of Arrival) for each device is estimated based on delays between each MIC elements. Several techniques such as interpolation and filtering are performed to enhance accuracy of AoA. Next, user location is estimated from triangulation, specifically with weighted least square (WLS) technique and real time weight optimization algorithm to lower the impact from reflection of the indoor environment. The algorithm achieves average error < 0.6 [m] with 8 voice assistants each containing 6 MIC arrays
